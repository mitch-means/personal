These are a few files from my Tracksy.AI website that I have moved over to this public repository

Index.jsp : This is the home page  
TrackManagerApi.java : This is a Java class to help with tracks - creating, renaming, deleting, looking up, etc.  
addWatermarkFile.py : The python code that runs as a Google Cloud function which creates a watermarked file
